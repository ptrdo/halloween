This tutorial exercises the fundamentals of HTML and CSS and how they can be combined to make a webpage look nice. 
### How This Tutorial Works

Those steps will be implemented in the subsequent file, so if there is any confusion about implementing an instruction, look-ahead to the next file to observe how it should be done. Since completing the steps will require saving the files, retain a copy of the originals to do this exercise again.
